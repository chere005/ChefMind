/**
 * The shopping list, and the pantry beside it (Sean, 2026-08-21 / 2026-08-22).
 *
 * ONE SCREEN, TWO TABS. Both are a flat list of things named in a line of
 * text, both are ordinary `reminder` records, and the only difference between
 * them is which folder flag they read — so they are one component taking a
 * flag rather than two files that have to be kept in step. The pantry is a
 * list of what you HAVE; the shopping list is what you need. See the `pantry`
 * flag's own comment in core's types.ts.
 *
 * The shopping list fills from the Recipes tab: pick several in edit mode and
 * their ingredients arrive here, combined by core's shoppingLines — which
 * leaves out anything already in the pantry. Typing straight into the field at
 * the top works on both, because the thing you forgot is never in a recipe.
 *
 * BY AISLE, not by the order you dragged them (Sean, 2026-08-22: "shopping
 * should separate ingredients by the categories you might find them in the
 * grocery store"). A shopping list is walked, so the useful order is the route
 * through the shop. Dragging still works and still writes `ord` — but the
 * display sorts by aisle FIRST, so a drag reorders within its own aisle and a
 * row dragged into another one returns to its own. That is deliberate: the
 * aisle is derived from what the row says, so moving the row cannot change it,
 * and pretending otherwise would mean a row that silently snapped back with no
 * reason given.
