/**
 * Measures, converted — so a shopping list can say how much to buy in ONE
 * unit per thing instead of repeating itself.
 *
 * Sean, 2026-08-22: "sum the total amount needed to purchase in a consistent
 * unit by type... grams/ml if possible, even if converted properly... or
 * cups/oz if necessary.. tsp/tbsp are all fine".
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHAT DID NOT. shopping.ts used to refuse all conversion,
 * on the grounds that turning '1 cup butter' into grams means choosing a
 * density and a list that invents numbers is worse than one that repeats
 * itself. That reasoning is still exactly right — and it only ever applied
 * ACROSS dimensions. A cup is 236.588 ml by definition, on any planet, for any
 * substance: converting volume to volume invents nothing. So:
 *
 *   - within MASS      → grams, exactly
 *   - within VOLUME    → millilitres, exactly
 *   - across the two   → REFUSED, still, and for the original reason
 *
 * A unit this file does not recognise (clove, can, stick, pinch, 'large') is
 * its own bucket and combines only with itself. That is not a gap: 3 cloves
 * and 2 cans have no common measure, and a shopping list is happier saying
 * both than guessing at either.
