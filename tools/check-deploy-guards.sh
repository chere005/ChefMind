# Does deploy.sh's guard set still refuse what it claims to refuse?
#
# Every check here works by BREAKING a copy of the real script and watching it
# stop — never by reading it. The method is CalMind's
# tools/check-deploy-guards.sh, where two gates that could not fail printed
# reassuring output for months; no assertion here passes unless the tampered
# copy exits non-zero.
#
# EVERY copy has its ssh, rsync and curl calls replaced with echo. This is not
# belt-and-braces: the point of each case is that a guard has been removed, so
# the copy WILL reach the transfer step whenever the check is doing its job
# and finding a real hole. (curl too — the destination guards run before the
# API gate and never reach it, but a check that only works because of an
# ordering it does not state is one refactor from silently hitting the
# network.)
#
# Nothing here needs SSH_DEST, credentials or a network — the guards run
# before deploy.conf is read, deliberately, so this is runnable by anyone.
