/**
 * The icon-only bottom tab bar: Recipes · Pantry · Shopping. The active tab
 * wears a fixed circle behind its icon — a highlight that can never move the
 * tabs' spacing. The bar's contents cap at the same width as the page column,
 * so on a wide window the tabs stay under the content instead of flying to
 * the edges.
 *
 * Upstream this has five: the calendar and habits sit either side of a raised
 * accent + . ChefMind keeps the shopping list and nothing else — Sean,
 * 2026-08-21: "remove reminders from ChefMind". A cooking app that also held
 * a general reminders list was holding CalMind's job.
 *
 * The PANTRY joined it 2026-08-22 (Sean: "add a third tab to chefmind which is
 * a list of groceries on hand"). Pantry sits beside Recipes rather than beside
 * Shopping, even though the two lists are the same component: they are
 * opposites — what you have and what you need — and putting them adjacent is
 * how you tap the wrong one.
 *
 * The + went 2026-09-15 (Sean: "remove the + page from ChefMind"), and with it
 * the only raised control the bar had, so every tab is now the same shape. It
 * filed ONE kind — a recipe — into a section chosen from a dropdown, which is
 * the thing the Recipes screen's own + beside each section does in place,
 * already looking at the section it files into. Adding from the bar meant
 * naming that destination blind. Shopping and pantry rows were never its job;
 * each of those lists has its own + .
 *
 * The `reminder` RECORD type stays, and is not a leftover: the shopping rows
 * are reminder records in a folder of their own. What went is the screen.
