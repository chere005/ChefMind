/**
 * The tree the typecheck and the suites read, as one hash.
 *
 *   node tools/gate-key.mjs            prints the key (64 hex) and nothing else
 *   node tools/gate-key.mjs --files    lists the paths it read, for the prover
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. A tdtp ran the same typecheck and the same core suite twice
 * over the same files, a few seconds apart: once in tools/dtp.sh's --full pass,
 * before anything is touched, and again inside deploy.sh. The bump between
 * them touches only version numbers, which neither tsc nor vitest reads. That
 * second run cost about seven seconds and proved nothing the first had not.
 *
 * So the --full pass records this key for the tree it just checked, and
 * deploy.sh skips its own run ONLY when the tree still hashes to the same key.
 * Anything else, such as a file another session saved mid-lane, a new file, or
 * an `npm install`, gives a different key, and deploy.sh then checks the tree
 * as it always did. That run can still fail and stop the deploy. The reuse is
 * proven by content on every run, never assumed and never by time:
 * tools/check-deploy-guards.sh breaks a copy of the tree in each way below and
 * watches the key move.
 *
 * WHAT IS IN IT. Everything tsc and vitest can read, plus more than they do.
 * Missing an input would be a hole; including too much only means a run that
 * did not need to happen. A key over a few named paths was proposed first, and
 * it had a hole. `tsc -p app` has no `include`, so it typechecks every
 * .ts/.tsx/.js under app/, dist's bundles included (expo's base sets allowJs).
 * A stray app/e2e/x.ts would have been checked by tsc and missed by the key.
 *   - app/, packages/ and spec/, whole, every file at any depth. Dot-dirs are
 *     included because vitest globs with `dot: true`. Left out: node_modules
 *     (keyed below), app/ios and app/android (excluded by expo's tsconfig, and
 *     no test reads them) and .DS_Store.
 *   - the root files that configure either tool: tsconfig*.json,
 *     package.json, package-lock.json, .npmrc, and any vite/vitest/babel/
 *     postcss config or .env.
 *   - node_modules: npm's own record of what is installed,
 *     node_modules/.package-lock.json, which every install rewrites. Also the
 *     NAMES in each node_modules here, top level and @scope, so a package
 *     dropped in by hand also moves the key. Hashing all 42,000 files would
 *     cost more than the run this saves. The one thing left unkeyed is a hand
 *     edit inside an installed package mid-lane.
 *   - node's version, the platform, and TZ and NODE_OPTIONS from the
 *     environment.
 *
 * WHAT IS TAKEN OUT: exactly the fields the bump rewrites, and only in the
 * files the key reads. That is `version` in the root package.json,
 * `expo.version` in app/app.json, and the workspace `version` fields
 * tools/sync-lock-versions.mjs rewrites in package-lock.json. No source file
 * imports app.json or a package.json.
 *
 * NO KEY IS A SAFE ANSWER. Anything this cannot read plainly makes it exit
 * non-zero and print nothing: a symlinked directory it would have to follow,
 * a socket, an unreadable file. Both callers treat an empty key as "run the
 * checks", so a failure here costs seconds and never skips a gate.
