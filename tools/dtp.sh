# dtp — deploy, tag, push. The release gesture for ChefMind.
# tdtp — the same lane with the full test run in front: tools/tdtp.sh, which
# calls this with --full. (Sean's shorthand, 2026-08-22: dtp = deploy, tag,
# push; tdtp = test, deploy, tag, push.)
#
# What a run does, in order:
#   0. refuse a tree with uncommitted TRACKED changes — the tag must name
#      exactly what shipped
#   1. (--full only) typecheck + core suite, before anything is touched
#   2. bump the MINOR version (x.y.0 → x.(y+1).0) in the five files that move
#      together, and commit the bump — UNLESS the current version is still
#      untagged, which means a previous run bumped and then failed before
#      tagging: that version is reused, not skipped past. Re-running a failed
#      dtp is therefore safe and does not burn a number.
#   3. ./deploy.sh --yes-prod       (the gates live in there; a failed deploy
#                                    stops everything — never tag around one)
#   4. the macOS bundle, from the export deploy.sh just shipped — BEFORE the
#      tag, so a broken desktop build leaves the version untagged and a re-run
#      reuses it, exactly as a failed deploy does
#   5. tag X.Y.0 (BARE — no v) (annotated)
#   6. git push --follow-tags
#   7. dispatch the desktop-windows workflow (CI builds the pushed tree);
#      a dispatch failure is reported but does not un-ship the release
#   8. the device builds — iOS on the phone, Android on an emulator — AFTER
#      the push and reported rather than fatal, because the release has
#      already happened and an unplugged phone must not read as a failed one
#
# THIS REPO SHIPS ITSELF. Steps 4 and 8 were CoreMind's alone until
# 2026-08-23, and the hole that left was invisible from inside either repo: a
# release could tag and push with the Mac bundle still built from whatever was
# lying around. It did — the .app was a day behind and had never heard of the
# Pantry tab. Sean: "This repo should be able to ship itself (and needed
# dependencies) on its own... coremind is to ship all apps simultaneously."
#
# WHICH PLATFORMS: naming one selects only it, naming none means all of them —
# tools/build-platforms.sh's own convention. `--web` is how you say "the
# release and no platform builds".
#
# A dtp bumps the MINOR version — standing rule, every app in the suite.
# ios.buildNumber / android.versionCode are NOT touched here: those move by
# hand per device build.
