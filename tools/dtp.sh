# dtp — deploy, tag, push. The release gesture for ChefMind.
# tdtp — the same lane with the full test run in front: tools/tdtp.sh, which
# calls this with --full. (Sean's shorthand, 2026-08-22: dtp = deploy, tag,
# push; tdtp = test, deploy, tag, push.)
#
# What a run does, in order:
#   0. refuse a tree with uncommitted TRACKED changes — the tag must name
#      exactly what shipped
#   1. (--full only) typecheck + core suite + app suite, before anything is
#      touched, and the content key of the tree they passed on
#   2. bump the MINOR version (x.y.0 → x.(y+1).0) in the five files that move
#      together, and commit the bump — UNLESS the current version is still
#      untagged, which means a previous run bumped and then failed before
#      tagging: that version is reused, not skipped past. Re-running a failed
#      dtp is therefore safe and does not burn a number.
#   3. ./deploy.sh --yes-prod       (the gates live in there; a failed deploy
#                                    stops everything — never tag around one;
#                                    its typecheck and core suite stand down
#                                    only for the very tree step 1 passed)
#   4. the macOS bundle, from the export deploy.sh just shipped — BEFORE the
#      tag, so a broken desktop build leaves the version untagged and a re-run
#      reuses it, exactly as a failed deploy does
#   5. PREFLIGHT, right before the tag: tools/preflight.sh runs the Release
#      workflow's builds (Windows .msi/.exe, macOS dmg, on GitHub) on this very
#      commit, publishing nothing. A failure stops the lane exactly as step 4
#      does: the version stays untagged and a re-run reuses it. Never tag
#      around a failed preflight; --skip-preflight is the deliberate way past.
#   6. tag X.Y.0 (BARE — no v) (annotated)
#   7. git push --atomic --follow-tags — the tag push starts the Release
#      workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml), which builds the installers
#      and publishes ONE GitHub release for the version
#   8. find the Release run the tag push started and print its URL; a run that
#      cannot be found is reported but does not un-ship the release
#   9. the device builds — iOS on the phone, Android on an emulator — AFTER
#      the push and never fatal TO THE RELEASE, because the release has
#      already happened and an unplugged phone must not un-ship it.
#  10. watch the Release run (it has been running beside the device builds) and
#      report the published release's URL. A Release failure is the same kind
#      of thing as a device build that did not finish: the deploy stands, the
#      tag stands, and the failure is reported loudly with the exact command to
#      re-run it (gh run rerun <id> --failed).
#      The lane still exits non-zero if a device build or the Release did not
#      finish (see the foot of this file): the release stands, the exit status
#      does not lie about it.
#
# THIS REPO SHIPS ITSELF. Steps 4 and 9 were CoreMind's alone until
# 2026-08-23, and the hole that left was invisible from inside either repo: a
# release could tag and push with the Mac bundle still built from whatever was
# lying around. It did — the .app was a day behind and had never heard of the
# Pantry tab. Sean: "This repo should be able to ship itself (and needed
# dependencies) on its own... coremind is to ship all apps simultaneously."
#
# WHICH PLATFORMS: naming one selects only it, naming none means all of them —
# tools/build-platforms.sh's own convention. `--web` is how you say "the
# release and no platform builds".
#
# A dtp bumps the MINOR version — standing rule, every app in the suite.
# ios.buildNumber / android.versionCode are NOT touched here: those move by
# hand per device build.

# A SINGLE-REPO RELEASE IS STILL A RELEASE. Sean, 2026-08-23: "i dont see the
# tdtp from ChefMind on status". CoreMind's bin/dtp.sh had reported to
# seancheren.com/status since the page existed; a repo shipping ITSELF did not,
# so the page went quiet for exactly the runs nobody else knew were coming — and
# the history graph recorded no purple for them at all.
#
# NEVER FATAL. report-status.sh exits 0 on every failure path by design, and the
# `|| true` here covers the case where CoreMind is not checked out beside this
# repo at all. A status page must never be the thing that stops a release.
# A BATCH OWNS ITS OWN CARD. When CoreMind's orchestrator runs this lane as
# part of `dtp all`, it has already opened one run for the whole plan and
# passes its id down — reporting again would draw a second card for a job that
# is one job (Sean, 2026-08-23: "there should be one card per tdtp if multiple
# jobs are triggered in one batch"). Run alone, MIND_RUN_ID is unset and this

# because the lane could not pick a phone out of the two paired to this machine
# (that half is fixed in build-platforms.sh, which disambiguates by name now;
# this is the other half). CoreMind's bin/dtp.sh ends non-zero on exactly this
# and says why in one line — "it all worked" cannot be read off the exit
# status — so this lane matches it rather than growing a second convention.
#
# LAST IN THE FILE, deliberately. REPORT_DONE is already 1 and the `finish`
# call above has already run by the time control reaches this, so the exit
# cannot jump the status report, and the EXIT trap's failed-3 fallback stays
# suppressed — the run is finished, not stopped.
