# preflight - run the Release workflow's builds on the commit you are ABOUT to tag, before tagging it.
#
#   sh tools/preflight.sh [tag]
#
# It pushes HEAD to refs/heads/preflight/<sha7> (a branch push triggers nothing: the workflows react to tags and manual
# dispatches only), dispatches `Release` there with preflight=true, watches the run, and reports PASS or FAIL naming each
# failed job and step. Nothing is created, uploaded or published by a preflight run, and its jobs are continue-on-error, so a
# red job does not email anyone. The preflight branch is deleted at the end, always.
#
# The optional [tag] is the tag the commit is about to get; the workflow then checks that every version file carries it. Left
# out, the workflow derives the tag from the files and checks only that they agree.
#
# Exit: 0 PASS, 1 FAIL (or the run never appeared), 2 not ready to run (usage, dirty tree, no gh).
#
# One-time catch: GitHub dispatches a workflow by name only once release.yml is on the default branch, so the very first
# preflight has to wait until that file has been merged and pushed to main.
#
# POSIX sh; runs in Git Bash on Windows and on macOS/Linux.
