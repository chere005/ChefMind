# ChefMind

Recipes, a pantry and a shopping list.

## Disclaimer

Feel free to deploy this on your own website, build and deploy the iOS version, etc.

**This is a personal project to have some fun with claude code, which generated essentially all of the code, and the rest of this readme:**

## Notes

- Three tabs: Recipes · Pantry · Shopping.
- Uses CalMind accounts. No server of its own; records live on CalMind's.

## Building

```sh
npm install
npm run export:web && node tools/patch-web-html.mjs app/dist/index.html
CALMIND_DATA_DIR=/tmp/chefmind-dev-data php -S 127.0.0.1:8792 e2e-router.php   # then http://127.0.0.1:8792/ChefMind/
```

Needs a sibling `../CalMind` checkout. Phones: `sh tools/build-platforms.sh --ios` or `--android`. Desktop: `npm run desktop`. Release: `npm run dtp` (or `tdtp`, tests first); the tag builds the installers on GitHub.
