/**
 * Variants of one recipe card.
 *
 * Sean, 2026-08-22, looking at the Cheese card: "there should be a dropdown
 * next to the 1/2x 1x and 2x buttons that lets you choose a varient, Ricotta,
 * Marscapone, Mozzarella/Burrata... you select which ones are shown for each
 * varient".
 *
 * One card can hold several things you might actually make. Cheese is four:
 * two acid-set, two rennet-set, sharing a shopping list and a page. Splitting
 * it into four notes would mean four places to fix a typo; showing all of it
 * at once means reading past three recipes to cook one.
 *
 * A variant is a NAME plus a set of the card's own subheaders — "For the
 * béchamel:" and its kind, the sections a recipe body is already divided into.
 * Choosing a variant hides the subheaders it does not name, and the rows under
 * them; everything before the first subheader is SHARED and always shown,
 * because that is where a card puts the things every version needs.
 *
 * Sections are named by their TEXT, not by an index. A variant pointing at
 * "the third subheader" would silently mean something else the moment one was
 * added above it, and a recipe is edited far more often than its variants are.
 * The cost is that renaming a subheader detaches it from every variant naming
 * it — which is visible (it stops being ticked) rather than silent (it starts
 * showing the wrong steps).

/**
 * Every subheader in a recipe body, in the order written, deduplicated.
 *
 * Deduplicated because a card may repeat one across the Ingredients and the
 * Directions blocks — Cheese does, deliberately: "**Ricotta:**" appears in
 * both — and a variant ticking it means both. That is the behaviour you want
 * and the reason the key is the text.

 * The body as one variant shows it.
 *
 * Everything up to the first subheader inside a block is shared and kept —
 * the **Ingredients** and **Directions** headings themselves, and any rows
 * that sit under them before a subheader claims the rest. After that, a run
 * belongs to the subheader above it and is kept only if the variant names it.
 *
 * A variant naming NOTHING shows the whole card. That is what a just-created
 * variant does before anything is ticked, and it is the right default: a
 * variant that hid everything would look like a broken recipe rather than an
 * unfinished setting.
 *
 * Steps are NOT renumbered. They are the author's numbers, and a variant is a
 * view — rewriting them here would mean the card and the variant disagree
 * about which step is step 4, in a recipe someone is following with wet hands.
