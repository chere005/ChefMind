/**
 * Putting a recipe's ingredients on the shopping list.
 *
 * Two screens do this now — the Recipes tab's edit mode, over several recipes
 * at once, and the Shop button on the Recipe page, over the one in front of
 * you (Sean, 2026-09-18). It lives here rather than in either of them because
 * the SECOND one is where a rule quietly grows a second version of itself:
 * the pantry filter, where the rows land, and what to say when nothing is
 * added are one behaviour, and a copy of it on the Recipe page would drift
 * the first time one of the three changed.
 *
 * What is NOT here is the combining — same thing, same unit, added together,
 * and the pantry match — which is core's `shoppingLines` and tested there.
 * This owns the store: what the pantry holds, where the rows go, and in what
 * order.

 *
 * WHAT IS ALREADY ON THE LIST IS COMBINED WITH, not appended beside. Sean,
 * 2026-09-18: "duplicate ingredients i don't have in my pantry should always
 * be combined automatically", of a list carrying two lines of all purpose
 * flour from two different recipes. A single add has always combined within
 * itself; what it could not do was see the list it was landing on, so every
 * add after the first grew a second row for the same thing. There WAS a
 * Refresh button for this and it left the bar on 2026-09-16 — a button for
 * "tidy what you already did" is a worse answer than doing it, and this file
 * is now `recombineLines`'s only caller.
 *
 * A row is rewritten ONLY when something actually folded into it, and it
 * keeps its id and its place. That matters: the alternative — rebuilding the
 * whole list — throws away the order somebody dragged it into and the wording
 * they edited on rows nothing was even added to.
 *
 * What is genuinely new lands at the END, after whatever is already there. A
 * prepend would push a half-shopped list down the screen every time.
